The `wulfflow` code aims to provide a workflow for quickly creating wulffshape for arbitrary materials. The code makes use of [Quacc](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/quacc) and [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) to perform concurrent calculations while aiming to be modular and flexible.
